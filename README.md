# GraphsStructurewithPython
My first, small python project. Within this small exercise project, I try to implement a graph structure
with nodes and edges. I´ll also provide a TGF Parser/Reader for proper input. Maybe there will be some small 
graphical representation just for fun. 

I´ll use the 'Click'-library for CLI-parsing.
